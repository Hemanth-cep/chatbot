        description : "ZenGPT is a language model developed by OpenAI. It is based on the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) architecture. The model is trained on a diverse range of internet text and is capable of understanding and generating human-like text based on the input it receives.Users can interact with ZenGPT through a text interface, asking questions, seeking information, or engaging in conversation. It's designed to generate coherent and contextually relevant responses. While it can be a powerful tool for various natural language processing tasks, it's essential to note that ZenGPT's responses are generated based on patterns learned during training and may not always be completely accurate or up-to-date.",

        title: "Zens Creation",
        description : "ZenGPT was developed through a two-step process: pre-training and fine-tuning. In the pre-training phase, the model was exposed to a diverse dataset containing internet text, learning to predict the next word in a sentence based on context. This phase enabled the model to grasp grammar, facts, reasoning, and some world knowledge. Subsequently, the model underwent fine-tuning on a specific dataset with human reviewers following OpenAI's guidelines. These guidelines aimed to refine the model's behavior, ensuring it produces safe and appropriate responses.",
